# Tip calculator
When traveling to new countries, understanding the tipping culture in restaurants can be a challenge. Some nations welcome tips, others consider them obligatory, while some may even find tipping insulting. 
To mitigate potential inconveniences and ensure a positive dining experience, I've developed a user-friendly C++ program for calculating tips. 
This program takes into account both the bill amount and your selected country, providing you with the appropriate tip amount, thus facilitating a seamless and respectful tipping experience.


Furthermore, this program offers valuable additional information about each country's tipping customs, aiding you in making informed decisions about gratuities. 
This information not only ensures a smooth dining experience but also promotes cultural sensitivity and etiquette when it comes to tipping.


This program contains the tip percentages of around thirty-five most sought after tourist countries. Based on those percentages the program generates tip from the amount you give.
